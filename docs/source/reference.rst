NeuroArch Python API consists of 

1. an Object Graph Mapping (OGM) that implements the data model described in the `Neurokernel Request for Comment \#5 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.44225.>`_,
2. a high level API for loading and querying the database using languages familiar to neurobiologists and computational neuroscientists,
3. a low level API for constructing queries that are understood by OrientDB database.

The references below represents the three parts of the NeuroArch Python API. In addition, it provides a reference for the supporting utilities.
